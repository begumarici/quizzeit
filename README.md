# QuizZeit

**QuizZeit** is a fun and educational quiz application designed to improve German and English vocabulary skills. The application selects 10 random questions from a JSON file for each quiz session. At the end of the quiz, users can view a summary of their answers and evaluate their performance.

## 🚀 Project Purpose

This project was developed to make language learning more effective and engaging. Initially created as a personal tool to support my own German learning journey, it has grown into an application that anyone interested in improving their language skills can easily use.
